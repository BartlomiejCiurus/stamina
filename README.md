## Notes
Use macros to validate the migration steps.

Make a type class based format system with bridges to spray JSON, etc.

Use macros to generate formats

Generate AST transformers with macros?

Also build a binary implementation based on Kryo. Use macros to generate a Kryo format. But how to implement migrations? Generate intermediate case classes? Use an intermediate AST-like structure like a map? Use compiler trees directly and transform them?
